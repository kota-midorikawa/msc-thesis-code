# Quantum Heat Engine Simulation with Coherence

This repository contains Python code used in my master's thesis research on quantum heat engines with coherence effects, conducted at the University of Tokyo, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences.

## Overview

The project simulates quantum heat engine dynamics using the QuTiP library. It investigates thermodynamic performance under the influence of quantum coherence in both linear and nonlinear regimes.

## Features

- Time evolution of density matrices via Lindblad master equation  
- Calculation of work, heat, and efficiency  
- Comparison between coherent and incoherent cases  
- Visualization of quantum state trajectories

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- QuTiP  
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- Matplotlib  

To install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
